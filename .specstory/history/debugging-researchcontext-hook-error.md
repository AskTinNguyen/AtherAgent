## Debugging ResearchContext Hook Error (2/13/2025, 11:29:53 AM)

_**User**_

The application is throwing an error because the ⁠useResearchContext hook is being used outside of the ⁠ResearchActivityProvider. This is happening in the ⁠ResearchHeader component. The error message indicates that the ⁠ResearchContext is not available in the component’s scope. The Redis client is connected.

Check @research-activity-context.tsx

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you analyze and fix the issue with the `ResearchActivityProvider` and `useResearchContext` hook. Let me examine the research activity context implementation.

I see that the `research-activity-context.tsx` file is currently open. Let me analyze the context implementation to identify any potential issues.

The current implementation shows that:
1. The `ResearchActivityProvider` is correctly set up with both `ResearchContext` and `ActivityContext`
2. The `useResearchContext` hook is properly implemented with error checking
3. The provider structure is nested correctly

However, I notice that we should add some additional type safety and error handling to make the context more robust. Let me make these improvements.

I'll edit the file to enhance the context implementation:

---

_****_

```diff
  const ActivityContext = createContext<ActivityContextType | null>(null)
  const ResearchContext = createContext<ResearchContextType | null>(null)
+ 
+ // Provider check utilities
+ function assertContextExists<T>(
+   context: T | null,
+   contextName: string
+ ): asserts context is T {
+   if (context === null) {
+     throw new Error(
+       `${contextName} must be used within its Provider. ` +
+       'Please ensure the component is wrapped in ResearchActivityProvider.'
+     )
+   }
+ }
  
  // Combined Provider
  }
  
- // Hook
+ // Hooks with enhanced error messages
  export function useActivity() {
    const context = useContext(ActivityContext)
-   if (!context) {
-     throw new Error('useActivity must be used within an ActivityProvider')
-   }
+   assertContextExists(context, 'useActivity')
    return context
  }
  
  export function useResearchContext() {
    const context = useContext(ResearchContext)
-   if (!context) {
-     throw new Error('useResearchContext must be used within a ResearchActivityProvider')
-   }
+   assertContextExists(context, 'useResearchContext')
    return context
  } 
```

---

I've made several improvements to the context implementation:

1. Added a type-safe `assertContextExists` utility function that provides better error messages and type assertions
2. Enhanced the error messages to explicitly guide developers to wrap components in `ResearchActivityProvider`
3. Improved the hook implementations to use the new assertion utility

Now, to fix the error you're experiencing with the `ResearchHeader` component, you need to ensure that the `ResearchHeader` component is wrapped with the `ResearchActivityProvider`. This should be done at a higher level in your component tree, typically in your app's layout or main page component.

Let me check your app structure to see where we should place the provider:

I can see that the `ResearchHeader` component is being used in multiple places, but most importantly in the `DeepResearchVisualization` component. Let's check how this component is being used:

After analyzing the codebase, I can see that the issue is in the component hierarchy. The `ResearchHeader` component is trying to use the `useResearchContext` hook, but it's not properly wrapped in the `ResearchActivityProvider`. Here's the hierarchy:

1. The `Header` component renders `DeepResearchVisualization`
2. `DeepResearchVisualization` renders `ResearchCommandCenter`
3. `ResearchCommandCenter` renders `ResearchHeader`
4. `ResearchHeader` uses `useResearchContext`

The issue is that the `DeepResearchVisualization` component is not wrapped in the `ResearchActivityProvider`. Let's fix this by wrapping it in the provider:

---

_****_

```diff
  import { ChevronLeft } from 'lucide-react'
  import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
+ import { ResearchActivityProvider } from './contexts/research-activity-provider'
  import { useDeepResearch } from './deep-research-provider'
  import { ErrorBoundary } from './shared/error-boundary'
    return (
      <ErrorBoundary>
+       <ResearchActivityProvider>
          <style jsx global>{`
            @keyframes glow {
            />
          </div>
+       </ResearchActivityProvider>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    )
```

---

I see there's a linter error because the import path is incorrect. Let me fix the import path:

---

_****_

```diff
  'use client'
  
+ import { ResearchActivityProvider } from '@/lib/contexts/research-activity-context'
  import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'
  import { ChevronLeft } from 'lucide-react'
  import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
- import { ResearchActivityProvider } from './contexts/research-activity-provider'
  import { useDeepResearch } from './deep-research-provider'
  import { ErrorBoundary } from './shared/error-boundary'
```

Great! I've made the following changes to fix the issue:

1. Added the `ResearchActivityProvider` to wrap the content in `DeepResearchVisualization`
2. Fixed the import path to correctly import from `@/lib/contexts/research-activity-context`

This should resolve the error you were seeing with the `useResearchContext` hook in the `ResearchHeader` component. The context will now be properly available throughout the component tree.

The component hierarchy is now:
```
DeepResearchVisualization
└── ResearchActivityProvider
    └── ResearchCommandCenter
        └── ResearchHeader (can now use useResearchContext)
```

The error should be resolved now. The `ResearchHeader` component will have access to the research context through the `useResearchContext` hook.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

Great. Now when i click on the Toggle Button, i still don't see the research panel visualization.

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the issue. Looking at the code, I notice a few potential problems:

1. The `DeepResearchVisualization` component is using both `useDeepResearch` and wrapping its content in `ResearchActivityProvider`, which might cause state synchronization issues.

2. The visibility logic might be too restrictive. Let's check the conditions:
```typescript
if (initialClearedState || (!state.isActive && state.activity.length === 0 && isInitialized)) {
  return null
}
```

3. The collapsible state might not be properly synced with the active state.

Let me modify the `DeepResearchVisualization` component to fix these issues:

---

_****_

```diff
  }: DeepResearchVisualizationProps) {
    const { state, clearState, setActive, initProgress } = useDeepResearch()
-   const [isCollapsed, setIsCollapsed] = useState(false) // Start expanded by default
+   const [isCollapsed, setIsCollapsed] = useState(false)
    const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false)
  
    }, [setActive, initProgress, clearState, state.activity.length, state.maxDepth, state.currentDepth, isInitialized])
  
-   // Show panel when there's research activity
+   // Show panel when research becomes active
    useEffect(() => {
-     if (state.activity.length > 0 && isCollapsed) {
+     if (state.isActive && isCollapsed) {
        setIsCollapsed(false)
      }
-   }, [state.activity.length, isCollapsed])
+   }, [state.isActive, isCollapsed])
  
-   // Hide if no activity or cleared
-   if (initialClearedState || (!state.isActive && state.activity.length === 0 && isInitialized)) {
+   // Only hide if explicitly cleared
+   if (initialClearedState) {
      return null
    }
          `}</style>
  
-         {/* Chevron Button - Only show if there's activity */}
-         {state.activity.length > 0 && (
+         {/* Chevron Button */}
          <Button
            variant="ghost"
            size="icon"
            onClick={() => setIsCollapsed(!isCollapsed)}
-             className="fixed left-2 top-[calc(50vh-2rem)] rounded-full text-foreground/30 z-50"
+           className={cn(
+             "fixed left-2 top-[calc(50vh-2rem)] rounded-full text-foreground/30 z-50",
+             !state.isActive && "opacity-50"
+           )}
          >
            <ChevronLeft 
              size={32} 
              className={cn(
                "glow-effect",
-                 isCollapsed && "rotate-180"
+               isCollapsed && "rotate-180",
+               state.isActive && "text-primary"
              )}
            />
          </Button>
-         )}
  
          {/* Panel Container */}
          <div className={cn(
-           "fixed inset-y-0 left-0 z-40",
+           "fixed inset-y-0 left-0 z-40 transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out",
            location === 'header' ? 'block lg:hidden' : 'hidden lg:block',
-           isCollapsed && "w-0 pointer-events-none"
+           isCollapsed ? "w-0 opacity-0" : "w-[440px] opacity-100"
          )}>
            <ResearchCommandCenter
```

I've made several important changes to fix the visibility issue:

1. Simplified the visibility logic:
   - Now only hides the component when `initialClearedState` is true
   - Removed the overly restrictive condition that was checking activity length and initialization

2. Improved the toggle button behavior:
   - Always visible but with reduced opacity when inactive
   - Shows a primary color when research is active
   - Added smooth transitions for better UX

3. Enhanced the panel container:
   - Added proper transition animations
   - Fixed the width toggle with opacity for smoother transitions
   - Made the collapse/expand animation smoother with duration and easing

4. Changed the auto-expand trigger:
   - Now expands when research becomes active instead of just checking activity length
   - This should better sync with the toggle button state

The panel should now be visible when you click the toggle button, with smooth animations for collapsing and expanding. The button itself will also be more responsive and provide better visual feedback about the research state.

Try clicking the toggle button again - you should see the panel slide in from the left with a smooth animation. The button should also rotate to indicate the panel state.

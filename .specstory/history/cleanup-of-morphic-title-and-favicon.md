I can see that the title and logo are defined in a few places. Let me first check the app layout file to update the title.

---

_****_

Read file: app/layout.tsx

---

_****_



Now let me check the header component where the logo is defined.

---

_****_

Read file: components/header.tsx

---

_****_



Let me also check the icon component to see how the logo is implemented.

---

_****_

Read file: components/ui/icons.tsx

---

_****_



I'll make the following changes:

1. Update the title in `app/layout.tsx`
2. Update the logo in `components/ui/icons.tsx` to use a dice emoji
3. Update the sr-only text in `components/header.tsx`

Let me make these changes one by one:

---

_****_

```diff
  })
  
- const title = 'Morphic'
+ const title = 'AtherAgent'
  const description =
    'A fully open-source AI-powered answer engine with a generative UI.'
```

---

_****_

```diff
  function IconLogo({ className, ...props }: React.ComponentProps<'svg'>) {
    return (
-     <svg
-       fill="currentColor"
-       viewBox="0 0 256 256"
-       role="img"
-       xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
-       className={cn('h-4 w-4', className)}
-       {...props}
-     >
-       <circle cx="128" cy="128" r="128" fill="black"></circle>
-       <circle cx="102" cy="128" r="18" fill="white"></circle>
-       <circle cx="154" cy="128" r="18" fill="white"></circle>
-     </svg>
+     <div className={cn('text-lg', className)} {...props}>
+       ðŸŽ²
+     </div>
    )
  }
```

---

_****_



Let me fix the type error in the icons component:

---

_****_

```diff
  import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'
  
- function IconLogo({ className, ...props }: React.ComponentProps<'svg'>) {
+ function IconLogo({ className, ...props }: React.ComponentProps<'div'>) {
    return (
      <div className={cn('text-lg', className)} {...props}>
-       ðŸŽ²
+       ï¿½ï¿½
      </div>
    )
```

---

_****_



I notice there's an issue with the emoji encoding. Let me fix that:

---

_****_

```diff
    return (
      <div className={cn('text-lg', className)} {...props}>
-       ï¿½ï¿½
+       {'ðŸŽ²'}
      </div>
    )
```

---

_****_

```diff
          <a href="/">
            <IconLogo className={cn('w-5 h-5')} />
-           <span className="sr-only">Morphic</span>
+           <span className="sr-only">AtherAgent</span>
          </a>
        </div>
```

---

_****_



I've made all the necessary changes:

1. Updated the title from 'Morphic' to 'AtherAgent' in `app/layout.tsx`
2. Replaced the SVG logo with a dice emoji (ðŸŽ²) in `components/ui/icons.tsx`
3. Updated the screen reader text from 'Morphic' to 'AtherAgent' in `components/header.tsx`

The changes should now be reflected in your application. The title in the browser tab should show "AtherAgent" and the logo in the header should be a dice emoji. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to these changes!

---

_**User**_

I still don't see the dice ðŸŽ² on the tab page 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. We need to add a favicon to the page. In Next.js 13+, we can add a favicon by placing it in the `app` directory. Let me help you set that up.

First, let me check if there's an existing favicon:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app â€¢ **11** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `layout.tsx` |
| ðŸ“„ `bookmarks` |
| ðŸ“„ `api` |
| ðŸ“„ `auth` |
| ðŸ“„ `chart-test` |
| ðŸ“„ `favicon.ico` |
| ðŸ“„ `globals.css` |
| ðŸ“„ `opengraph-image.png` |
| ðŸ“„ `page.tsx` |
| ðŸ“„ `search` |
| ðŸ“„ `share` |

</details>

---

_****_



I see there's an existing `favicon.ico`. We need to update it with our dice emoji. To do this, we'll need to:

1. Update the metadata in `app/layout.tsx` to include the favicon configuration
2. Create and add a new favicon with the dice emoji

Let me update the metadata first:

---

_****_

```diff
    title,
    description,
+   icons: {
+     icon: [
+       {
+         url: '/icon.png',
+         href: '/icon.png'
+       }
+     ]
+   },
    openGraph: {
      title,
```

---

_****_



Now, we need to create a PNG file with the dice emoji. I'll create a command to generate this using the `convert` command from ImageMagick:

---

_****_



---

_****_



---

_**User**_

dice_icon.png

Can you use this image instead?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I'll update the metadata to use `dice_icon.png` instead of `icon.png`:

---

_****_

```diff
      icon: [
        {
-         url: '/icon.png',
-         href: '/icon.png'
+         url: '/dice_icon.png',
+         href: '/dice_icon.png'
        }
      ]
```

---

_****_



Make sure to place the `dice_icon.png` file in the `public` directory of your Next.js project. The path should be `public/dice_icon.png`. This will make it accessible at the URL `/dice_icon.png` in your application.

Would you like me to help you move or copy the file to the correct location?

---

_**User**_

i've moved it

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! The dice icon should now appear as the favicon in your browser tab. If you're not seeing it yet, you might need to:

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Hard refresh the page (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)

The changes we made to `layout.tsx` to use `dice_icon.png` should pick up the icon from the public directory. Let me know if you're still not seeing it after trying these steps!

---

_**User**_

i still see the same favicon as before, no dice_icon.png can be seen

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the current favicon setup and make sure everything is configured correctly.

I see the issue. There's still a `favicon.ico` in the `app` directory which is taking precedence. Let's remove it and update the metadata to ensure it uses our `dice_icon.png`:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me try a different approach. Let's update the metadata configuration to be more specific:

---

_****_

```diff
    description,
    icons: {
-     icon: [
-       {
-         url: '/dice_icon.png',
-         href: '/dice_icon.png'
-       }
-     ]
+     icon: '/dice_icon.png',
+     shortcut: '/dice_icon.png',
+     apple: '/dice_icon.png'
    },
    openGraph: {
```

---

_****_



Now let's try to remove the old favicon using a terminal command:

---

_****_

```bash
rm app/favicon.ico
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % 

```

---

_****_



I've made two changes:
1. Removed the old `favicon.ico` file that was taking precedence
2. Updated the metadata configuration to use more specific icon settings

Please try:
1. Hard refresh your browser (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Or clear your browser cache and reload

You should now see the dice icon as the favicon. Let me know if you're still not seeing it!

---

_**User**_

no i don't see any icon

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me try a different approach. In Next.js 13+, we can also use a special `icon.png` or `favicon.ico` file directly in the app directory. Let's try this method:

1. First, let's check if the dice_icon.png is in the correct format and location:

---

_****_



---

_****_



---

_**User**_

i notice the old favicon.ico has a .ico format. do we need to change?

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes, that's a good observation! The `.ico` format is the traditional format for favicons and is still widely supported. Let's convert the `dice_icon.png` to `.ico` format. We can do this by:

1. Keeping the favicon configuration in `layout.tsx` to use `.ico` format
2. Converting and placing the icon in the correct location

Let me update the metadata first:

---

_****_

```diff
    description,
    icons: {
-     icon: '/dice_icon.png',
-     shortcut: '/dice_icon.png',
-     apple: '/dice_icon.png'
+     icon: '/favicon.ico'
    },
    openGraph: {
```

---

_****_



Now we need to convert the PNG to ICO format. You'll need to:

1. Convert the `dice_icon.png` to `favicon.ico` using an online converter or image editing tool
2. Place the resulting `favicon.ico` file in the `app` directory

Would you like me to suggest some online tools for converting PNG to ICO, or would you prefer to use a different approach?

---

_**User**_

done. i've uploaded it under favicon.ico in the public folder

---

_**Assistant**_



Since you've placed the `favicon.ico` in the `public` folder, we need to make sure the metadata in `layout.tsx` points to the correct location. Let me update that:

---

_****_

```diff
    description,
    icons: {
-     icon: '/favicon.ico'
+     icon: '/favicon.ico',
+     shortcut: '/favicon.ico'
    },
    openGraph: {
```

---

_****_



Now try:
1. Hard refresh your browser (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Or clear your browser cache and reload

You should see the new dice favicon. Let me know if it's still not showing up!

---

_**User**_

i only see the standard global icon

---

_**Assistant**_



Let's try a different approach. In Next.js 13+, the most reliable way to set a favicon is to place it directly in the `app` directory. Let's:

1. Move the favicon.ico from public to app directory
2. Simplify the metadata configuration

---

_****_

```bash
mv public/favicon.ico app/favicon.ico
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % 

```

---

_****_







Now let's simplify the metadata configuration:

---

_****_

```diff
    title,
    description,
-   icons: {
-     icon: '/favicon.ico',
-     shortcut: '/favicon.ico'
-   },
    openGraph: {
      title,
```

---

_****_







Now that we've:
1. Moved the `favicon.ico` directly to the `app` directory
2. Removed the explicit icons configuration (Next.js will automatically detect `favicon.ico` in the app directory)

Please:
1. Stop your Next.js development server
2. Start it again
3. Hard refresh your browser (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)

You should now see the dice favicon. Let me know if it's still not showing up!

---

_**User**_

make icon size of the icon in the main @chat-panel.tsx  3 times bigger

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the icon size in the `chat-panel.tsx` where it's used for the empty state. Looking at the code, I can see it's using the `size-12` class currently.

---

_****_

```diff
        {messages.length === 0 && (
          <div className="mb-8">
-           <IconLogo className="size-12 text-muted-foreground" />
+           <IconLogo className="size-36 text-muted-foreground" />
          </div>
        )}
```

---

_****_



I've updated the icon size from `size-12` (48px) to `size-36` (144px), which is 3 times larger. The linter error is unrelated to our icon size change and appears to be about the SearchDepthToggle component's props.

You should now see a much larger dice emoji icon on the main chat panel when there are no messages. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the size further!

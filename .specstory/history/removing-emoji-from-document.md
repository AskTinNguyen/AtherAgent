## Removing Emoji from Document (2/10/2025, 8:43:25 PM)

_**User**_

where can i remove the ðŸŽ² in this document

---

_**Assistant**_

I don't see any dice (ðŸŽ²) emoji in the currently shown code in `chat-panel.tsx`. Could you please point out where exactly you're seeing this emoji? If it's in a different file, could you share that file or its location so I can help you remove it?

_**User**_

it should be part of some icon

_**Assistant**_

I've searched through the provided code in `chat-panel.tsx` and I don't see any dice emoji (ðŸŽ²) being used as an icon. The icons that are currently being used in this file are:

1. `ArrowUp`
2. `Maximize2`
3. `MessageCirclePlus`
4. `Square`
5. `Type`
6. `Upload`
7. `IconLogo`

All of these are coming from either `lucide-react` or the custom `./ui/icons` component. Could you please point out where exactly you're seeing the dice emoji? It might be in a different component or file that we need to look at.

Let me search through the codebase to see if I can find it.

Ah, I found it! The dice emoji is in `components/ui/icons.tsx`. Let me take a look at that file to help you remove it.

Read file: components/ui/icons.tsx

I'll help you remove the dice emoji from the `IconLogo` component. Let me edit the file to remove it.

```diff
    return (
      <div className={cn('text-lg', className)} {...props}>
-       {'ðŸŽ²'}
+       {'A'}
      </div>
    )
```

I've replaced the dice emoji (ðŸŽ²) with the letter 'A' as a simple text logo. If you'd like a different logo or icon, I can help you:

1. Use a different text character
2. Add a proper SVG logo
3. Use an icon from a library like Lucide React
4. Or implement any other logo design you prefer

Would you like me to make any other changes to the logo?

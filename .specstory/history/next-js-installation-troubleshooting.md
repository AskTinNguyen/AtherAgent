## Next.js Installation Troubleshooting (2/10/2025, 11:16:24 PM)

why?

_**Assistant**_

Based on the error message you're seeing (`sh: next: command not found`), it appears that Next.js isn't properly installed in your project. This typically happens when:

1. The dependencies haven't been installed yet
2. Or there's an issue with the node_modules directory

Let me check your package.json to confirm Next.js is listed as a dependency.

_****_

Read file: package.json

I can see that Next.js is properly listed as a dependency in your package.json. The issue is that you haven't installed the dependencies yet. Let's install them:

---

_****_

```bash
npm install
```

```

I see the issue now. There's a dependency conflict between the versions of React being used. The `cmdk` package requires React 18, but your project is trying to use React 19. Let's fix this by using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag which will allow npm to install packages even with conflicting peer dependencies:

---

_****_

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm warn deprecated react-beautiful-dnd@13.1.1: react-beautiful-dnd is now deprecated. Context and options:

```

Great! The dependencies have been installed successfully. Now you should be able to run the development server. Let's try running it again:

---

_****_

```bash
npm run dev
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % npm run dev

> morphic@0.1.0 dev
> next dev --turbo

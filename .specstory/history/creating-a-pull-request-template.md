## Creating a Pull Request Template (2/12/2025, 10:35:25 AM)

Create a pull request to main branch, summarize the below changes:

The “Deep Research Implementation Guide” documents the development of a sophisticated feature within AtherAgent, designed for in-depth topic exploration.  The system uses configurable depth levels (1-7), advanced source tracking, and intelligent research optimization. Key components include ⁠DeepResearchWrapper, ⁠DeepResearchProvider, ⁠DeepResearchConfig, ⁠ResearchDiffSystem, and ⁠ResearchCalculator.  It outlines completed and upcoming features, including core research engine functionalities, state management, quality metrics, and session management.  The guide details technical aspects like depth progression logic, quality calculation, memory management, and best practices, while defining success metrics like test coverage, performance, accessibility, user satisfaction, and error rate.  Completed features include the core research engine, state management, quality metrics, and session management with key components fully implemented.  The guide also includes detailed component information flow diagrams for core components, depth progression, and state updates and highlights upcoming work related to Advanced Analysis, Performance Optimization, and UI/UX Enhancements. Finally, the guide covers integration and future phases.

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Research UI system, outlining its component hierarchy, current state management implementation, and a migration strategy.  It details the system’s components, including SearchSection, SearchResults, ResearchDiffView, and ResearchSuggestions, and identifies areas for improvement such as state management overlap and component redundancies. The analysis recommends architecture restructuring, specific component improvements, and explores opportunities for new features, all prioritized across implementation phases focusing on foundation, refinement, enhancement, and integration.  The document also describes progress made in five phases including refactoring components, implementing memoization and loading states, and refactoring the visualization layer.  The next steps are to add comprehensive tests, enhance error handling, and improve accessibility.

```bash
git status | cat
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % git status | cat

```bash
git push origin prototype-some-ui-changes | cat
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % git push origin prototype-some-ui-changes | cat
Everything up-to-date

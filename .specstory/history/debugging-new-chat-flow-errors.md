## Debugging New Chat Flow Errors (2/14/2025, 1:26:40 AM)

_**User**_

using New Chat gives a 404 Error @chat.ts 

I think it's the rendering of Chat Message when user is triggering the new chat flow @chat-messages.tsx. Otherwise it's working fine with existing history chats. 

When checking the console log, i'm getting this 

"Uncaught (in promise) Error: Access to storage is not allowed from this context."

Please check @redis and explore possible errors space and discuss with me. Don't code yet until i tell you

I'll help analyze the potential issues around the 404 error and storage access error when creating a new chat. Let me examine the relevant code and explore possible error spaces.

First, let me check the chat-related Redis implementation:

---

_****_

Read file: lib/redis/chat.ts

---

_****_



Let me also check the chat-messages component:

---

_****_

Read file: components/chat-messages.tsx

---

I'm also getting this

_**Assistant**_

I see the additional error logs you've shared. There are two main issues happening:

1. **Storage Access Error**:
```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Access to storage is not allowed from web-client-content-script.js:2
```
This suggests there's an issue with accessing browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) from a context where it's not allowed. This typically happens when trying to access storage APIs from a restricted context like a content script or when there are permission issues.

2. **Avatar Image 404**:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/avatar.png 404 (Not Found)
```
This is causing a cascade of React layout effect errors because an image resource is failing to load, triggering multiple re-renders and layout recalculations.

Looking at the error stack trace, it's showing a chain of layout effect commits and recursive traversals, which suggests React is struggling to stabilize the layout due to these issues.

Potential root causes:

1. **Storage Access Issue**:
- The error is coming from a client-side script trying to access storage in a restricted context
- This could be related to how the chat state or user session is being managed
- The error occurs in a promise, suggesting it's happening during an async operation

2. **Layout Effect Chain**:
- Starting from `useImageLoadingStatus.useLayoutEffect`
- Cascading through multiple `commitLayoutEffectOnFiber` and `recursivelyTraverseLayoutEffects` calls
- This suggests a potential issue with image loading states and layout calculations

Before I propose solutions, could you help me understand:
1. Are you using any browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) for managing chat state?
2. Is the avatar image supposed to be a user avatar or a default avatar?
3. When exactly does this error occur - immediately when creating a new chat, or after some specific action?

This will help me pinpoint the exact cause and suggest the most appropriate solution.

we should be using Local Redis. can you check?
This error occur - immediately when creating a new chat. along with a 404 - This page cannot be found error.

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the Redis implementation for chat creation. From what I can see, there might be a disconnect between the client-side chat creation flow and the Redis storage implementation.

Let me check a few key areas:

Let me also check the Redis chat implementation:

---

_****_

Read file: lib/redis/config.ts

---

_****_



After analyzing the code, I can identify several potential issues that could be causing the 404 error and storage access problems:

1. **Redis Client Access Issue**:
```typescript
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  throw new Error('Redis client can only be used on the server side')
}
```
The Redis client is strictly server-side only, but it seems there might be attempts to access it from the client side during the new chat creation flow.

2. **Missing Chat Creation API Route**:
Looking at the API routes, there isn't a dedicated endpoint for creating a new chat. The current `/api/chat` route only handles:
- GET: fetching existing chats
- POST: handling chat messages/streaming

3. **Storage Context Error**:
The error "Access to storage is not allowed from web-client-content-script.js" suggests that some client-side code is trying to access storage in a restricted context. This could be happening because:
- The chat creation flow might be trying to access Redis directly from the client side
- There might be a mix of client/server storage operations

4. **Chat State Management**:
The chat messages component (`chat-messages.tsx`) is clearing messages when chatId changes:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  setOpenStates({})
  setStreamState({
    isStreaming: false,
    currentMessageId: null,
    streamedContent: '',
    toolCallStatus: 'none'
  })
  setMessages([]) // Clear messages when chatId changes
}, [chatId, setMessages])
```
But if the new chat creation fails, this could lead to an inconsistent state.

Here's what I think is happening:
1. When creating a new chat, the client is trying to initialize a new chat session
2. The Redis operations are failing because they're being attempted from the client side
3. This causes the chat creation to fail, resulting in a 404
4. The avatar 404 is likely a secondary issue - the UI is trying to load an avatar for a chat that hasn't been properly created

To fix this, we would need to:
1. Create a proper server-side API endpoint for new chat creation
2. Ensure all Redis operations are server-side only
3. Implement proper error handling for the chat creation flow
4. Fix the avatar loading logic to handle cases where the chat isn't fully initialized

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these fixes?

_**User**_

ok but check our @api first before creating anything new

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll check the API structure more thoroughly, particularly the `/api/chats` directory since it seems separate from `/api/chat`:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/api/chats â€¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `[chatId]` |

</details>

---

_****_



Let me check what's inside the `[chatId]` directory:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/api/chats/[chatId] â€¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `research` |

</details>

---

_****_



Let me also check the `/api/chat` directory since that's our main chat endpoint:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/api/chat â€¢ **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `route.ts` |
| ðŸ“„ `[id]` |

</details>

---

_****_



Let me check what's in the `[id]` directory:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/api/chat/[id] â€¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `route.ts` |

</details>

---

_****_



Let me check the main chat route.ts since it seems to handle the core chat functionality:

---

_****_

Read file: app/api/chat/route.ts

---

_****_



Let me also check the chat actions since they're imported in the route:

---

_****_

Read file: lib/actions/chat.ts

---

_****_



After reviewing the API structure and implementation, I can see the issue more clearly now:

1. The chat creation flow is handled through server actions in `lib/actions/chat.ts`, which includes:
   - `saveChat`: For creating/updating chats
   - `getChats`: For retrieving chats
   - `getChat`: For getting a specific chat

2. The issue is likely in the flow between client and server when creating a new chat. The 404 error suggests that we're trying to access a chat that hasn't been properly created yet.

Looking at the error:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/avatar.png 404 (Not Found)
```
This suggests that the UI is trying to load an avatar before the chat is properly initialized.

And the storage error:
```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Access to storage is not allowed from web-client-content-script.js:2
```
This indicates that there might be a race condition where the client is trying to access storage before the server action completes.

The fix should focus on:
1. Ensuring the chat is properly created through the server action before any client-side operations
2. Handling the loading state properly to prevent premature avatar loading
3. Making sure all storage operations are handled server-side through the proper actions

Would you like me to:
1. Show you where I think the issue is in the client-side code?
2. Propose specific fixes for the chat creation flow?
3. Look at any specific part of the codebase you think might be relevant?

_**User**_

the avatar used to be in client-header.tsx but we deleted it and combine everything in @sidebar.tsx 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, now I understand better! The 404 error for `/avatar.png` is a remnant from when we had the avatar in `client-header.tsx`. Since we've moved and combined everything into `sidebar.tsx`, we need to clean up any remaining avatar references.

Let me check the sidebar-related components to find where the avatar reference might still be:

---

_****_

Read file: components/sidebar/sidebar-header.tsx

---

_****_

Read file: components/sidebar/sidebar-content.tsx

---

_****_



Let me check the chat component since it might be trying to load the avatar:

---

_****_

Read file: components/chat.tsx

---

_****_



Let me check for any avatar-related files that might still be referenced:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me check the avatar component:

---

_****_

Read file: components/ui/avatar.tsx

---

_****_



Now I understand the issue. The 404 error for `/avatar.png` is happening because:

1. We've moved away from using a client header with an avatar to using the sidebar
2. However, there might still be a component somewhere trying to load the default avatar image at `/avatar.png`
3. The avatar component itself (`components/ui/avatar.tsx`) is a Radix UI component that expects an image source to be provided

Let me search for any remaining references to avatar.png:

Found it! The issue is in `components/sidebar/sidebar-footer.tsx`. It's still trying to load `/avatar.png` but we've removed that image.

Let me check the sidebar footer component:

---

_****_

Read file: components/sidebar/sidebar-footer.tsx

---

_****_



Now I see the exact issue. The sidebar footer is still trying to load `/avatar.png` in two places:

1. Line 27: `<AvatarImage src="/avatar.png" alt="User" />`
2. Line 88: `<AvatarImage src="/avatar.png" alt="User" />`

Since we've removed the avatar image, we should either:
1. Add a default avatar image to the public directory, or
2. Remove the `AvatarImage` component and just use the `AvatarFallback` with the logo

Would you like me to propose a fix for this issue? I can suggest both approaches and you can decide which one you prefer.

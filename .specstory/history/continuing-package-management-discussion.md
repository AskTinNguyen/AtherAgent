Lets continue

_**Assistant**_

I notice from the context that we were previously working on package management and deployment-related tasks, with some recent npm installation errors. However, since the context is truncated and you've asked to continue, I'll need to gather more information about the current state to provide appropriate assistance.

Let me check the current state of the package.json file and any recent changes:

---

_****_

Read file: package.json

---

_****_



Let me also check the recent changes to understand what we were working on:

---

_****_

I see that we have a package.json file set up with various scripts and dependencies, including a deploy script that runs `scripts/deploy.sh`. Let me check if this deploy script exists and its contents:

---

_****_

Read file: scripts/deploy.sh

---

_****_



Based on the context and files I've examined, I can see that:

1. We have a properly configured package.json with all necessary scripts and dependencies
2. There's a comprehensive deploy.sh script that handles the deployment process
3. We were previously working on npm installation errors

However, I don't see the specific npm installation error that was mentioned in the truncated context. To help you effectively, could you please:

1. Share the specific npm installation error you were encountering?
2. Let me know if there are any particular aspects of the deployment or package configuration you'd like me to focus on?

This will help me provide more targeted assistance for continuing our work.

@__tests__ we're working on these

_**Assistant**_

I see we're focusing on the test files in the `lib/tools/research/__tests__` directory. Let me analyze these test files to understand their structure and purpose.

Let me examine the test files to understand what we're working with:

---

_****_

Read file: lib/tools/research/__tests__/integration.test.ts

---

_****_

Read file: lib/tools/research/__tests__/performance.test.ts

---

_****_



I see we have a comprehensive test suite for the research tools with several key test files:

1. `integration.test.ts` - Tests the complete research workflow integration
2. `performance.test.ts` - Tests performance characteristics and behavior under load
3. `query-relevance.test.ts` - Tests query relevance functionality
4. `content-generator.test.ts` - Tests content generation
5. `topic-extractor.test.ts` - Tests topic extraction
6. `query-processor.test.ts` - Tests query processing

The tests are well-structured and follow the Jest testing framework guidelines. They include:
- Integration tests for the complete workflow
- Performance tests with specific thresholds
- Error handling scenarios
- Concurrent request handling
- Memory usage monitoring

Would you like me to:
1. Review and enhance any specific test file?
2. Add more test cases for particular scenarios?
3. Improve the performance testing thresholds?
4. Add new test categories?

Please let me know which aspect of the test suite you'd like to focus on, and I'll help you improve it.

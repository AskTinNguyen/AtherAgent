## Update Project Tracker with Latest Commits (2/13/2025, 9:26:21 AM)

_**User**_

check project's latest github commits over the last week and update the @MasterProjectTracker.md 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you check the recent GitHub commits and update the MasterProjectTracker.md accordingly. Let me fetch the recent commits first.

I notice I'm getting an error trying to fetch the commits directly. Let me try using the local git command to get the commit history instead.

I apologize, but I'm having trouble accessing the git history directly. In this case, I'll need your help. Could you please:

1. Run `git log --since="1 week ago"` in your terminal and share the output with me, or
2. Share the recent commits that you'd like to have documented in the MasterProjectTracker.md

Once you provide the commit information, I'll help update the MasterProjectTracker.md with the latest commit history. This will help maintain an accurate record of the project's progress.

The current MasterProjectTracker.md has a placeholder for February 10th commits and some previous notable commits, but we should update it with the actual recent commit history to keep it current.

Check why tool list comments are failing

_**Assistant**_

I'll help investigate why the tool calls for listing commits are failing. Let me check a few things:

1. First, let me check if we're in the correct repository directory:

pwd && ls -la | cat

2. Now let me check if git is properly initialized and configured:

---

_****_

```bash
git remote -v | cat
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % git remote -v | cat
origin  https://github.com/AskTinNguyen/AtherAgent.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/AskTinNguyen/AtherAgent.git (push)
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent %
```

I see the issue now. The GitHub API tools were failing because we were using incorrect repository information. The actual repository details are:

- Owner: `AskTinNguyen` (not `tinnguyen`)
- Repository: `AtherAgent`

Let me try the commit listing again with the correct information:

Now I'll update the MasterProjectTracker.md with the latest commits. Let me edit the file:

7. Documentation Updates

Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect of these commits or help with updating other sections of the MasterProjectTracker.md?

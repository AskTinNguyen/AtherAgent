## Testing Tool Implementation with npm (2/10/2025, 11:08:10 PM)

_**User**_

@research Now that we've implemented these tools, let's check what we have

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you examine the research tools implementation. Let me check the contents of these files to understand what we have.

First, let me look at the main entry point:

---

_****_

Read file: lib/tools/research/index.ts

---

_****_



Let me check each of the main tools to understand their functionality:

---

_****_

Read file: lib/tools/research/query-processor.ts

---

_****_

Read file: lib/tools/research/topic-extractor.ts

---

_****_

Read file: lib/tools/research/content-generator.ts

---

_****_

Read file: lib/tools/research/query-relevance.ts

---

_****_



Based on my analysis, we have implemented a comprehensive set of research tools that work together to provide sophisticated research capabilities. Here's a summary of what we have:

1. **Query Processor** (`query-processor.ts`):
   - Cleans and analyzes search queries
   - Extracts key information like topics, entities, and intent
   - Provides query complexity scoring
   - Suggests relevant tools for the query
   - Uses GPT-4 Turbo for processing

2. **Topic Extractor** (`topic-extractor.ts`):
   - Extracts and analyzes topics from content
   - Scores topic relevance to the query
   - Identifies subtopics and keywords
   - Provides query alignment scoring
   - Suggests search terms for refinement

3. **Content Generator** (`content-generator.ts`):
   - Generates structured content from research sources
   - Supports markdown and JSON output formats
   - Includes citation management
   - Optional chart generation capability
   - Provides metadata like word count and reading time
   - Uses GPT-4 Turbo for content generation

4. **Query Relevance** (`query-relevance.ts`):
   - Scores and analyzes source relevance against queries
   - Considers factors like content relevance, freshness, and authority
   - Provides detailed analysis of each source
   - Generates summary statistics and recommendations
   - Configurable relevance threshold

All tools:
- Use strong type safety with Zod schemas
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Support optional research context
- Provide confidence scores for their outputs
- Are integrated through a central `index.ts`
- Use OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model
- Follow consistent error handling patterns
- Include detailed TypeScript types

The tools form a cohesive research pipeline where:
1. Queries can be processed and understood
2. Topics can be extracted and analyzed
3. Content can be generated with citations
4. Sources can be evaluated for relevance

Would you like me to dive deeper into any particular aspect of these tools or examine specific functionality in more detail?

Based on @README.md let's run the app

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you run the app following the Quickstart instructions from the README. Let's go through this step by step.

1. First, let's check if we're in the correct directory:

---

_****_

```bash
pwd
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % pwd
/Users/tinnguyen/AtherAgent
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent %
```

---

_****_



Great! We're already in the correct directory. Now let's follow the steps:

2. Install dependencies using Bun (as recommended in the README):

---

_****_



---

---

_**User**_

it should be npm

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, I apologize for suggesting Bun. Let's use npm instead as specified in your changes:

---

_****_

```bash
npm install
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % npm install

> @ather/research-tools@1.0.0 prepare
> husky install

husky - Git hooks installed

up to date, audited 342 packages in 579ms

  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.

3. Now, let's set up the environment variables. We need to copy the example file:

---

_****_

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % cp .env.local.example .env.local
cp: .env.local.example: No such file or directory
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent %
```

---

_****_



I see there was an error because the file is named differently. Let me check for the correct environment file:

---

_****_

I see the correct files now. The example file is `.env.example`, and I notice you already have a `.env.local` file. Since you already have the `.env.local` file, we can skip the copying step.

4. Now we can run the development server:

---

_****_

```bash
npm run dev
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % npm run dev
npm error Missing script: "dev"
npm error
npm error To see a list of scripts, run:
npm error   npm run
npm error A complete log of this run can be found in: /Users/tinnguyen/.npm/_logs/2025-02-10T16_13_03_155Z-d
ebug-0.log
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent %
```

---

_****_







Let me check the package.json to see what the correct script name is:

---

_****_

Read file: package.json

---

_****_



---

_**User**_

try npm again

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you've updated the package.json. Let's try running the development server again:

---

_****_

```bash
npm run dev
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % npm run dev
npm error Missing script: "dev"
npm error
npm error To see a list of scripts, run:
npm error   npm run
npm error A complete log of this run can be found in: /Users/tinnguyen/.npm/_logs/2025-02-10T16_13_44_010Z-d
ebug-0.log
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent %
```

---

_****_



I see that even though we updated the `prepublishOnly` script, we still don't have a `dev` script defined in the package.json. Let's add the `dev` script to the package.json:

---

_****_

```diff
      "prepare": "husky install",
      "prepublishOnly": "npm run dev",
-     "deploy": "bash ./scripts/deploy.sh"
+     "deploy": "bash ./scripts/deploy.sh",
+     "dev": "next dev"
    },
    "dependencies": {
```

---

_****_







Now let's try running the development server again:

---

_****_

```bash
npm run dev
```

```
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent % npm run dev

> @ather/research-tools@1.0.0 dev
> next dev

sh: next: command not found
tinnguyen@Tins-MacBook-Pro AtherAgent %
```

---

I see the issue now. We need to install Next.js as a dependency since it's not currently installed. Let's add it:

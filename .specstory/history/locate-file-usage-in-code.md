Based on my search of the codebase, I don't see any direct usage of `dice_icon.png` in `page.tsx` or anywhere else in the codebase. While the file exists in the public directory (as confirmed by the `list_dir` results), it doesn't appear to be referenced in any of the code files.

Looking at the current `page.tsx` file, I can see it's using a different image file (`wallpaper-bw.png`) as the background image. If you're looking to use `dice_icon.png` somewhere in the page, you'll need to add the reference where you want it to appear. Would you like me to help you add it somewhere specific in the page?

it could be a ðŸŽ² emoji appearing as a text

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes! Looking at the search results, I can see that the dice emoji (ðŸŽ²) is being used in the `IconLogo` component in `components/ui/icons.tsx`. Here's the relevant code:

```typescript
function IconLogo({ className, ...props }: React.ComponentProps<'div'>) {
  return (
    <div className={cn('text-lg', className)} {...props}>
      {'ðŸŽ²'}
    </div>
  )
}
```

So rather than using the `dice_icon.png` image file, the application is using the ðŸŽ² emoji character directly. This is actually a more efficient approach since:
1. It loads faster than an image
2. It scales well with different font sizes
3. It automatically inherits the text styling
4. It reduces the number of assets that need to be loaded

Since the `dice_icon.png` file isn't being used anywhere in the codebase, you could safely remove it from the public directory if you want to clean up unused assets.

Would you like me to help you remove the unused `dice_icon.png` file or would you prefer to keep it for potential future use?

remove it

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you remove the unused `dice_icon.png` file from the public directory.

The file has been deleted. The application will continue to use the ðŸŽ² emoji in the `IconLogo` component instead of the image file. This helps keep the codebase clean and reduces unnecessary assets. Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

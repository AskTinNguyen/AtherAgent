## Debugging Console Log Issue in Chat (2/12/2025, 2:50:19 PM)

_**User**_

Help me fix a bug where everytime i Type one single letter in the Chat Message @chat-panel.tsx , a console log of DeepResearch Context is being fired.

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you investigate and fix this issue. First, I'll search for any code related to the DeepResearch context and its usage.

I can see that the issue is coming from the `useDeepResearch` hook in the `deep-research-provider.tsx` file. There's a debug logging statement that's being called every time the context is accessed, which happens whenever the chat panel re-renders (including when typing).

Let me fix this by removing the unnecessary debug logging. I'll edit the file:

---

_****_

```diff
      throw new Error('useDeepResearch must be used within a DeepResearchProvider')
    }
- 
-   // Add debug logging
-   console.log('DeepResearch Context:', {
-     isActive: context.state.isActive,
-     activityCount: context.state.activity.length,
-     sourcesCount: context.state.sources.length,
-     currentDepth: context.state.currentDepth,
-     maxDepth: context.state.maxDepth
-   })
- 
    return context
  }
```

I also notice there's another debug logging in the `DeepResearchProvider` component that might be contributing to the issue. Let me remove that as well:

---

_****_

```diff
  function DeepResearchProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(deepResearchReducer, initialState)
- 
-   // Add debug logging
-   useEffect(() => {
-     console.log('DeepResearch Provider State:', {
-       isActive: state.isActive,
-       currentDepth: state.currentDepth,
-       activity: state.activity.length,
-       sources: state.sources.length
-     })
-   }, [state])
  
    // Add initialization effect
        payload: { totalSteps: 7 } 
      })
-     
-     // Log initial state
-     console.log('DeepResearch Provider Initialized:', state)
    }, [])
  
```

I've removed the unnecessary debug logging statements that were causing the console logs every time you typed in the chat panel. The linter errors are related to type definitions and exports, but they don't affect the functionality we just fixed.

The changes I made:
1. Removed the debug logging from the `useDeepResearch` hook that was logging context state on every access
2. Removed the debug logging from the `DeepResearchProvider` component that was logging state changes and initialization

You should no longer see the DeepResearch Context logs every time you type in the chat panel. The component will still function as expected, but without the unnecessary logging.

The remaining linter errors are related to TypeScript type definitions and export conflicts, which are separate issues from the logging problem we just fixed. If you'd like, we can address those type issues as well, but they don't affect the functionality of the chat panel or the logging issue.

Would you like me to help fix the TypeScript type issues as well?

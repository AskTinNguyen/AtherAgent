help me fix this url hyperlink. I can't navigate to file

_**Assistant**_

I notice that the URL in the markdown file seems to be pointing to `./src/components/research-suggestions.tsx`, but based on your project structure shown in the recently viewed files, it looks like your components are directly in a `components` directory rather than under `src/components`.

Let me search for the correct file location first.

I found the correct file location. Let me fix the URL in the markdown file.

```diff
  ### 3. Research Intelligence Components
  
- *   **[ResearchSuggestions (research-suggestions.tsx)](./src/components/research-suggestions.tsx)**
+ *   **[ResearchSuggestions (research-suggestions.tsx)](../components/research-suggestions.tsx)**
      *   Role: AI-powered research guidance
          *   Generates research suggestions
```

I've updated the link to point to `../components/research-suggestions.tsx` instead of `./src/components/research-suggestions.tsx`. This should now correctly point to the file in your project structure where components are located directly in the `components` directory. The link should now work properly for navigation.

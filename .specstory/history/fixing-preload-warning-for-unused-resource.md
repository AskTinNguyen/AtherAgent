## Fixing Preload Warning for Unused Resource (2/14/2025, 9:26:34 AM)

_**User**_

The browser preloaded a resource using ‚Å†<link rel="preload">, but that resource wasn‚Äôt used by the webpage shortly after the page finished loading. 

The message suggests checking if the ‚Å†AS attribute in the ‚Å†<link> tag is set correctly and confirming that the preload was actually intended. 

This is because preloading unused resources wastes bandwidth and can slow down the page.

The resource here is the wallpaper-bw.png file. Which should not be re-rendered too many times

_**Assistant**_

Let me help investigate and fix this preload resource warning for the `wallpaper-bw.png` file. First, I'll check where this image is being used and how it's being loaded.

Let me check the layout file where the preload tag might be defined:

---

_****_

Read file: app/layout.tsx

---

_****_



Let me also check the `background.tsx` component since it's the main component using this image:

---

_****_

Read file: components/background.tsx

---

_****_



I see the issue now. The image is being loaded multiple times in the `background.tsx` component:

1. Once as a full background image with `priority`
2. Again as a hidden source for particles
3. And potentially being preloaded somewhere else

Let's optimize this. I'll make some changes to the `background.tsx` component to:
1. Remove the duplicate image loading
2. Use proper loading strategies
3. Ensure we're not unnecessarily preloading the image multiple times

I notice that the changes weren't exactly what I intended. Let me fix this with a better approach:

Let me help you improve the visibility of the bookmark list by adding alternating row colors. First, I'll check the relevant files to make this change.

Based on the search results, I can see that the bookmark list is implemented in the `components/bookmark-manager.tsx` file. Let me modify the card styling to make even rows lighter for better visibility.

```diff
      SearchMetadata
  } from '@/lib/redis/types/bookmarks'
+ import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'
  import {
      FolderOpen,
  
    // Update the renderBookmarkCard function
-   const renderBookmarkCard = (bookmark: EnhancedBookmark) => (
-     <Card key={bookmark.id} className="mb-4">
+   const renderBookmarkCard = (bookmark: EnhancedBookmark, index: number) => (
+     <Card key={bookmark.id} className={cn("mb-4", index % 2 === 1 && "bg-muted/50")}>
        <CardHeader className="pb-2">
          <div className="flex justify-between items-start">
          ) : (
            <>
-             {filteredBookmarks.map(renderBookmarkCard)}
+             {filteredBookmarks.map((bookmark, index) => renderBookmarkCard(bookmark, index))}
              {hasMore && (
                <Button
```

I've made the following changes to improve the visibility of the bookmark list:

1. Added alternating row colors by using the index of each bookmark
2. Used the `cn` utility to conditionally apply the `bg-muted/50` class to odd-numbered rows (index % 2 === 1)
3. Updated the map function to pass both the bookmark and index to the renderBookmarkCard function
4. Added the missing import for the `cn` utility function

The changes will make even-numbered rows have the default background color, while odd-numbered rows will have a slightly lighter background color (using the muted color with 50% opacity). This creates a subtle alternating pattern that makes it easier to distinguish between different bookmark entries.

The effect is subtle but effective, using your theme's built-in color system to ensure it matches the overall design aesthetic while improving readability. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the contrast or styling?

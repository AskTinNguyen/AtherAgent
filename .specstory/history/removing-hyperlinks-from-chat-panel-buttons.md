I see that the social media buttons are actually in the `footer.tsx` component, not in the chat panel. Let me help you modify those buttons to remove the hyperlinks.

Read file: components/footer.tsx

I'll help you modify the footer component to remove the hyperlinks from the social media buttons. I'll edit the file to remove the `Link` components while keeping the icons.

```diff
- import Link from 'next/link'
  import React from 'react'
  import { SiDiscord, SiGithub, SiX } from 'react-icons/si'
            className="text-muted-foreground/50"
          >
-           <Link href="https://discord.gg/zRxaseCuGq" target="_blank">
-             <SiDiscord size={18} />
-           </Link>
+           <SiDiscord size={18} />
          </Button>
          <Button
            className="text-muted-foreground/50"
          >
-           <Link href="https://x.com/morphic_ai" target="_blank">
-             <SiX size={18} />
-           </Link>
+           <SiX size={18} />
          </Button>
          <Button
            className="text-muted-foreground/50"
          >
-           <Link href="https://git.new/morphic" target="_blank">
-             <SiGithub size={18} />
-           </Link>
+           <SiGithub size={18} />
          </Button>
        </div>
```

I've modified the footer component to remove all the hyperlinks (`Link` components) from the social media buttons. The changes include:

1. Removed the `Link` import from 'next/link'
2. Removed all `Link` components that were wrapping the social media icons
3. Kept the icons directly inside the `Button` components
4. Maintained all the styling and button properties

Now the social media icons will appear as buttons but won't be clickable links anymore. The buttons will still have their visual appearance and hover effects from the `ghost` variant, but they won't navigate to any URLs when clicked.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

Let me search specifically for any TradingView-related components since I noticed a reference to a ticker tape component.

this popup

_**Assistant**_

I see the popup in the screenshot - it's showing "⚡ Static route" with an "X" close button. This appears to be a notification or toast message related to static routing in the application.

Let me search for code related to this static route notification.

Let me try one more search to find any notifications or toasts related to static routes.

---

Based on my searches, I can see that this popup appears to be a notification that appears when a static route is being used in the application. This is likely a development-time indicator to help developers understand when they're accessing a static route versus a dynamic route in Next.js.

The popup shows:
1. A lightning bolt (⚡) icon - indicating a static route
2. The text "Static route"
3. An "X" close button

This is a built-in Next.js development feature that helps developers understand the routing behavior of their application. It appears in development mode to indicate that the current page is being served as a static route (pre-rendered at build time) rather than a dynamic route (rendered on-demand).

This indicator is not part of your application code but rather a development tool provided by Next.js itself. It won't appear in production builds of your application. It's meant to help developers understand the routing and rendering behavior of their Next.js application during development.

Would you like me to help you with anything else regarding the application's routing or any other features?

I want you to review The References Code @REF-deep-research-context.tsx @REF-deep-research-diff.js @REF-deep-research-suggestions.tsx 

GIve me analysis on our current code base.

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the reference code files and provide a comprehensive review. Let me fetch the relevant rules first to ensure we follow proper guidelines for reference code analysis.

Following the reference code rules, I'll analyze these files focusing on their core functionality, interfaces, and architectural patterns. Here's my analysis:

1. **Deep Research Context (@REF-deep-research-context.tsx)**

Key Components:
- A React Context implementation for managing deep research state
- Core Interfaces:
  ```typescript
  - ActivityItem: Tracks research activities (search, extract, analyze, etc.)
  - SourceItem: Represents research sources with relevance scoring
  - DeepResearchState: Manages overall research state and progress
  ```
- Notable Features:
  - Implements a reducer pattern for state management
  - Provides progress tracking with depth levels
  - Includes activity logging and source management
  - Uses TypeScript for type safety

2. **Deep Research Diff (@REF-deep-research-diff.js)**

Key Features:
- Advanced text diffing implementation using ProseMirror
- Core Functionality:
  - Sentence-level diff comparison
  - Document node patching
  - Text tokenization and comparison
- Notable Patterns:
  - Uses diff-match-patch algorithm
  - Implements custom node matching and comparison
  - Handles complex document structure modifications

3. **Deep Research Suggestions (@REF-deep-research-suggestions.tsx)**

Key Components:
- ProseMirror plugin for handling suggestions
- Core Features:
  - Position-aware suggestions in document
  - Interactive suggestion widgets
  - React integration with ProseMirror
- Notable Patterns:
  - Uses React portals for widget rendering
  - Implements custom decoration handling
  - Manages suggestion state through plugin system

Architectural Insights:

1. **State Management**
   - Uses React Context for global state
   - Implements reducer pattern for predictable state updates
   - Clear separation of concerns between different aspects of research

2. **Type Safety**
   - Strong TypeScript implementation
   - Well-defined interfaces for data structures
   - Proper type definitions for all major components

3. **Editor Integration**
   - Deep integration with ProseMirror
   - Custom plugin implementation
   - React-based widget system

4. **Research Workflow**
   - Structured approach to deep research
   - Progress tracking with depth levels
   - Activity logging and source management

Key Patterns to Consider:

1. **Progress Tracking**
   ```typescript
   interface DeepResearchState {
     currentDepth: number
     maxDepth: number
     completedSteps: number
     totalExpectedSteps: number
   }
   ```

2. **Activity Logging**
   ```typescript
   interface ActivityItem {
     type: 'search' | 'extract' | 'analyze' | 'reasoning' | 'synthesis' | 'thought'
     status: 'pending' | 'complete' | 'error'
     message: string
     timestamp: string
   }
   ```

3. **Source Management**
   ```typescript
   interface SourceItem {
     url: string
     title: string
     relevance: number
   }
   ```

Recommendations for Implementation:

1. **State Management**
   - Consider implementing a similar context-based state management
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
   - Implement activity logging for tracking research progress

2. **Editor Integration**
   - Consider using ProseMirror for advanced text editing
   - Implement custom plugins for specific functionality
   - Use React portals for widget rendering

3. **Research Workflow**
   - Implement depth-based research progression
   - Track and display research progress
   - Manage sources with relevance scoring

4. **Type Safety**
   - Use strict TypeScript configurations
   - Define clear interfaces for all data structures
   - Implement proper type checking

This reference code provides a solid foundation for implementing a deep research system with advanced text editing capabilities. The architecture shows good separation of concerns and strong typing, which would be beneficial to follow in our implementation while maintaining our own independent codebase.

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of this analysis or explore particular implementation patterns in more detail?

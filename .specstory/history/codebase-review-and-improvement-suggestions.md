_**Assistant**_

I'll help analyze your codebase based on the README.md and recently viewed files to suggest potential areas for improvement and next steps.

From reviewing your README.md, you have an impressive AI-powered search engine with many advanced features. Let me break down potential areas to work on based on priority and complexity:

1. **Testing Infrastructure**
I notice there's no mention of testing in the README or visible test files in the recently viewed files. Consider implementing:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for AI/Search providers
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Test coverage reporting

2. **Documentation Improvements**
While your README is comprehensive, there are some areas that could be enhanced:
- Add API documentation for key endpoints
- Create architecture diagrams
- Add troubleshooting guides
- Document error handling patterns
- Create contribution guidelines specifically for code style and testing

3. **Performance Optimization**
Based on the recently viewed files, you could focus on:
- Redis caching optimization
- Streaming performance metrics
- Client-side performance monitoring
- Load testing for concurrent users

4. **Security Enhancements**
Consider adding:
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation documentation
- Security best practices guide
- API key rotation mechanism
- Audit logging

5. **Feature Enhancements**
Some potential features to consider:
- Batch processing for research tasks
- Export functionality for research results
- Advanced filtering options for search results
- User preferences persistence
- Enhanced error recovery for streaming

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these areas? I can provide more specific recommendations or help you implement any of these suggestions.

Also, I notice you have several custom rules available. If you'd like to ensure any new work aligns with your existing coding principles and frameworks, I can fetch those rules to provide more targeted recommendations.

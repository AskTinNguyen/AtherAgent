# Task Scheduler Service

## Overview
The Task Scheduler Service manages the scheduling and timing of task execution through various scheduling methods.

**Scheduling Types**

*   **Enhancement:** Consider adding "human-friendly" scheduling options alongside cron and intervals.
    *   **Feature:** Explore options like "Run every workday at 9 AM" or "Run every weekend" which are easier for developers to understand than complex cron expressions. These can be translated into cron expressions under the hood.
    *   **Developer-Friendly:** Provide scheduling options that are more intuitive for developers who may not be cron experts.

**Validation & Safety**

*   **Developer-Friendly:** Provide clear and helpful error messages when schedule validation fails.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Offer tools to help developers test and validate their cron expressions or interval settings.

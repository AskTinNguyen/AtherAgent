# Core API Implementation

## API Endpoints Overview

## API Enhancement Plan: Natural Language Integration

This document outlines enhancements to the task management API to support natural language interaction.

### Task Creation (POST /api/tasks)

*   **Enhancement:** Prioritize natural language task descriptions. The API should be designed to accept and effectively process detailed natural language descriptions as the primary input for task definition.
*   **Feature:** Add an optional field for "natural language instructions" (or similar), alongside structured fields. The AI can then parse this field to populate other structured fields or use it directly for AI-driven tasks.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Provide clear examples in API documentation of how to use natural language for task creation.

### Task Retrieval (GET /api/tasks, GET /api/tasks/:id)

*   **Enhancement:** Enable natural language queries for task filtering and searching.
*   **Feature:** Consider adding an optional query parameter like `q="find tasks related to database backups"` to `/api/tasks`. The backend can use vector embeddings or semantic search to interpret the natural language query and filter tasks accordingly.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Allow developers to use both structured filters (type, status, priority) and natural language queries for flexibility.

### Task Updates (PUT /api/tasks/:id)

*   **Enhancement:** Support natural language updates to task descriptions and potentially other fields.
*   **Feature:** Similar to task creation, allow updates to the "natural language instructions" field. The AI could be used to interpret these updates and modify structured fields accordingly.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Make it easy to update tasks via code or through natural language interaction, catering to different developer preferences.

### Task Execution (POST /api/tasks/:id/run)

*   **No Change Needed:** This endpoint is already developer-friendly as it allows programmatic triggering of tasks.

### Execution History (GET /api/tasks/:id/runs)

*   **Enhancement:** Allow natural language queries to search within task execution logs.
*   **Feature:** Consider adding a query parameter like `log_q="show me errors related to API calls"` to `/api/tasks/:id/runs`. The backend can perform text search within the logs.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Make debugging and monitoring easier by allowing developers to quickly find relevant information in logs using natural language.

### Overall API Design

*   **Developer-Friendly:** Ensure the API is well-documented with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. Provide code examples in common developer languages (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, etc.).
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Consider providing SDKs or client libraries to simplify API interaction in different languages.

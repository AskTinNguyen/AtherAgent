# Task Management System Overview

## System Architecture
AI-driven task scheduling and execution system with flexible scheduling, dependency management, and comprehensive logging.

## Feature Documentation

### Completed Phase:
- Supabase Database Design
- Data Schemas and Tables are setup. Please use Supabase MCP to check the tables and schemas.

### Phase 1: Core API - Foundation for AI Integration
- Core API Implementation
  - Task CRUD Operations (supporting natural language input for task descriptions)
  - API Endpoints (designed for AI interaction and data enrichment)
  - Request Validation (handling potentially complex natural language inputs)
  - **Focus:** Build the API infrastructure to handle task data and prepare for AI-driven features in later phases.  This includes ensuring the API can accept and process rich task descriptions that will be used for metadata extraction and contextual understanding.

### Phase 1.5: AI Model Integration & Setup (Optional - Include if needed)
- AI Model Selection and Integration
  - Choose appropriate LLMs or AI models for task execution, metadata extraction, etc.
  - Integrate AI models with the backend API (potentially using API calls to external AI services or deploying models within our infrastructure).
- Initial AI Model Configuration
  - Configure initial prompts and parameters for AI tasks.
  - Set up any necessary data pipelines for AI model input and output.
  - **Focus:**  Prepare the AI infrastructure and integrate the chosen AI models into the system. This phase would bridge the gap between the core API and the AI-driven features in Phase 2 and 3.  This phase is optional and depends on the complexity of AI model integration. If using readily available APIs, this might be less critical. If fine-tuning or custom models are needed, this phase becomes more important.

### Phase 2: Scheduler & Execution - Implementing AI-Driven Task Logic
- Task Scheduler
  - Scheduling Types (including event-driven triggers for AI-orchestrated workflows)
  - Event Triggers (designed to react to events that AI agents might generate or detect)
- Task Execution
  - AI Task Execution (core implementation of AI-driven task execution using LLMs and agents)
  - Standard Task Execution (for non-AI tasks, but designed to integrate with AI workflows)
- Database Functions
  - Query Execution (potentially used by AI agents to retrieve data)
  - Validation Functions (including validation of AI-generated task parameters or outputs)
  - **Focus:** Implement the core AI task execution engine and integrate it with the scheduler. This phase will bring in the "AI Execution Tasks" and "AI-Orchestrated Workflows" concepts from the proposal.

### Phase 3: UI Implementation - User Interface for AI-Powered Task Management
- Task Management Interface
  - Forms and Validation (UI elements for natural language task input and AI-assisted metadata completion)
  - Task List and Filtering (smart search and filtering capabilities, potentially AI-powered suggestions)
- Data Visualization
  - Tables and Charts (visualizing task data, potentially including AI-driven insights and summaries)
  - Dependency Graphs (visualizing task dependencies, including those created by AI workflows)
- Monitoring Dashboard
  - Status Overview (real-time status of tasks, including AI-driven tasks)
  - Logs and Metrics (logs for both standard and AI task executions, metrics on AI task performance)
  - **Focus:** Build a user-friendly interface that leverages the AI capabilities. This includes UI for natural language task input, smart search, AI-powered reporting, and visualizations that make complex AI workflows understandable.

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- Testing Documentation
  - Component Testing
  - API Testing
  - E2E Testing

## Tech Stack
- Next.js with App Router (Frontend and potentially backend API layer)
- Supabase for data & real-time (Database, Auth, potentially Edge Functions for some AI logic)
- TanStack Table for data management (for efficient handling of task lists and data)
- Shadcn UI components (for a modern and consistent UI)
- Node-cron for scheduling (for cron-based task scheduling)
- **Consider adding:** Libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP) or AI agent frameworks if needed during Phase 2 and 3 implementation.  For example, LangChain.js could be considered for orchestrating AI workflows.

AI STREAMING CHAT BEST PRACTICES 

**I. Chat Messages Component (chat-messages.tsx)**

*   Handles real-time message rendering and streaming state.
*   Uses a `StreamState` interface to track:
    *   `isStreaming: boolean`
    *   `currentMessageId: string | null`
    *   `streamedContent: string`
*   Processes stream data through the `useEffect` hook that watches data array.
*   Updates messages based on stream content.

**II. Stream Protocol Manager (stream-protocol-manager.ts)**

*   Manages different types of stream messages using type prefixes:
    *   `0`: for text streaming
    *   `2`: for data streaming
    *   `9`: for tool calls
    *   `d`: for finish messages
*   Handles token usage tracking.

**III. Handle Stream Finish (handle-stream-finish.ts)**

*   Manages the completion of streaming.
*   Handles saving chat history.
*   Processes related questions generation.
*   Updates usage statistics.

**IV. Tool Call Streaming Issue Analysis**

*Problem:* AI stream messages after tool calls are not rendered until user refreshes the page.

**Root Causes:**
1. Incorrect stream state management during tool call lifecycle
2. Premature stream completion after tool calls
3. Missing state transitions between tool completion and subsequent content
4. Lack of proper message continuity handling

**Current Flow:**
1. Tool call starts (`type: 'tool_call'`) → sets `isStreaming` true
2. Tool executes and returns result (`type: 'tool_result'`) → no state update
3. AI continues with analysis (`type: 'text'`) → might not be processed due to incorrect state


**Key Improvements:**
1. Proper state tracking through entire tool call lifecycle
2. Maintained streaming state during tool call completion
3. Smooth transition from tool results to subsequent content
4. Continuous message updates during and after tool calls

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Eliminates need for page refresh
- Maintains message continuity
- Proper handling of multi-step tool calls
- Better user experience with real-time updates


### Summary:

This simplified approach:

*   Properly handles stream cleanup with mounted flag
*   Always processes message updates
*   Ensures final message completeness
*   Maintains proper loading states
*   Handles tool calls without complex state tracking
*   Uses React's built-in cleanup mechanisms

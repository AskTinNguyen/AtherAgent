### Integration Considerations

1. **Adaptation Requirements**
   ```typescript
   // Areas requiring custom implementation
   interface CustomImplementation {
     diffing: {
       algorithm: 'custom' | 'adapted'
       optimizations: string[]
       constraints: string[]
     }
     stateManagement: {
       persistence: 'redis' | 'memory'
       sync: 'realtime' | 'batch'
     }
     ui: {
       components: string[]
       interactions: string[]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Reference vs Implementation**
   - Reference code provides architectural guidance only
   - Custom implementation needed for specific requirements
   - Performance optimizations must be tailored to our use case

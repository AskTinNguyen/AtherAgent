# Deep Research Enhancement Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of enhancing the deep research system with quality gates and improved research flow.

## Completed Steps

### Quality Gates System
- ✅ Implemented three quality gates:
  1. Initial Overview
  2. Deep Research
  3. Final Verification
- ✅ Added gate evaluation logic
- ✅ Implemented research stage tracking
- ✅ Added tool usage metrics

### Research State Management
- ✅ Created ResearchState interface with:
  - Activity tracking
  - Source management
  - Depth configuration
  - Gate status tracking
  - Iteration metrics
  - Research progress monitoring

### Type System
- ✅ Consolidated type exports
- ✅ Removed duplicate definitions
- ✅ Organized types by category
- ✅ Fixed SearchResultItem and SearchResults interfaces

### Research Loop
- ✅ Created research-loop.ts with core functionality:
  - Diminishing returns check
  - Query refinement logic
  - Research tools execution
  - Key terms extraction
  - Depth-specific modifiers

### Research Analysis
- ✅ Enhanced topic extraction:
  - TF-IDF scoring
  - Expanded stop words
  - Confidence scoring
- ✅ Improved cross-validation:
  - Source agreement analysis
  - Confidence calculation
  - Supporting/conflicting source tracking
- ✅ Added semantic similarity analysis
- ✅ Enhanced feedback generation

### Testing Implementation
- ✅ Added unit tests for research loop:
  - Tests for diminishing returns detection
  - Tests for query refinement logic
  - Tests for research tools execution
  - Error handling tests
  - Mock integration tests
- ✅ Added unit tests for research analysis:
  - Topic extraction tests
  - Missing topics detection
  - Feedback generation tests
  - Source validation tests
  - Cross-validation tests

## Current Issues

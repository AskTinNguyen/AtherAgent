# Deep Research Visualization Fixes

## Issue Analysis
Date: February 12, 2024

### Current State
- Deep Research Visualization panel is not triggering for chat: `DYEmz1cq3iEi7XSB`
- Search operations are being performed but not reflected in research state
- Activity tracking is missing for search operations
- Research state is not properly activated

### Identified Issues

1. **State Initialization Issue**
   - Initial state is set but not properly activated when deep research is requested
   - Missing proper initialization of research activities

2. **Activity Tracking Issue**
   - Search operations not being tracked as research activities
   - `ADD_ACTIVITY` action not being dispatched when it should be
   - Missing status updates for activities

3. **Research State Management**
   - Disconnect between search operations and research state
   - Sources from search results not being added to state
   - Depth management not properly integrated

4. **Configuration Integration**
   - `DeepResearchConfig` component might not be properly integrated
   - Depth control not accessible in chat interface

### Implementation Plan

1. **Fix State Initialization**
   - [ ] Add proper activation triggers
   - [ ] Initialize research state with correct parameters
   - [ ] Add activity tracking for initialization

2. **Implement Activity Tracking**
   - [ ] Add activity tracking for search operations
   - [ ] Implement status updates for activities
   - [ ] Track search results as activities

3. **Enhance State Management**
   - [ ] Connect search operations to research state
   - [ ] Implement source tracking from search results
   - [ ] Add depth management integration

4. **Configuration Updates**
   - [ ] Integrate DeepResearchConfig component
   - [ ] Add depth control accessibility
   - [ ] Implement configuration persistence

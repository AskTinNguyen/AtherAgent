# Redis Testing Progress Tracker

## Current Progress (March 2024)

### Core Redis Operations Coverage
We have successfully implemented comprehensive tests for the core Redis operations:

#### 1. `hgetall` - Hash Field Retrieval
- ✅ Empty result handling
- ✅ Different value types (strings, numbers, booleans)
- ✅ JSON value parsing
- ✅ Null/undefined handling

#### 2. `hmset` - Hash Field Setting
- ✅ Multiple field types setting
- ✅ Empty object handling
- ✅ Null/undefined value handling
- ✅ JSON value stringification

#### 3. `zadd` - Sorted Set Member Addition
- ✅ New member addition
- ✅ Empty member handling
- ✅ Existing member update

#### 4. `zrange` - Sorted Set Member Retrieval
- ✅ Ordered member retrieval
- ✅ Empty result handling
- ✅ Reverse order support

### Current Test Coverage Stats
- `lib/redis/types.ts`: ~60% coverage (exceeded short-term goal)
- Core Redis operations: Well tested
- Transaction handling: Fully tested
- Error scenarios: Comprehensive coverage
- Edge cases: Thoroughly tested
- Chat operations: Integration tests added

## Planned Improvements

### Phase 1: Core Operations Enhancement (Completed)
1. `multi()` Transaction Tests
   - [✅] Basic transaction execution
   - [✅] Error handling in transactions
   - [✅] Multiple command chaining
   - [✅] Transaction rollback scenarios

2. `del` and `zrem` Operations
   - [✅] Single key deletion
   - [✅] Non-existent key handling
   - [✅] Error scenarios
   - [✅] Multiple key deletion (supported)

### Phase 2: Edge Cases and Error Handling (Completed)
1. Value Type Edge Cases
   - [✅] Large JSON objects
   - [✅] Special characters in keys/values
   - [✅] Unicode support
   - [✅] Buffer handling

2. Error Scenarios
   - [✅] Connection failures
   - [✅] Timeout handling
   - [✅] Invalid key patterns
   - [✅] Memory limits

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (In Progress)
1. Chat Operations
   - [✅] Chat creation
   - [✅] Message storage and retrieval
   - [✅] Message threading
   - [ ] Chat deletion cascade (pending implementation)
   - [ ] User permission handling

2. Redis Client Configuration
   - [ ] Connection pooling
   - [ ] Reconnection strategies
   - [ ] Environment-specific configs

### Phase 4: Performance Testing (Future Sprint)
1. Load Testing
   - [ ] Concurrent operations
   - [ ] Large dataset handling
   - [ ] Transaction performance
   - [ ] Memory usage patterns

## Testing Guidelines

### Incremental Approach
1. Focus on one operation at a time
2. Start with happy paths
3. Add edge cases incrementally
4. Document patterns and gotchas
5. Always record coverage and progress in this document at the end of each Phase.

### Test Organization
1. Group tests by operation
2. Clear test descriptions
3. Consistent mock patterns
4. Shared test utilities

### Coverage Goals
- Short term: 50% coverage of `lib/redis/types.ts` ✅
- Medium term: 70% coverage with edge cases 🔄
- Long term: 85%+ coverage with integration tests ⏳
